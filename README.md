angular-phonegap-seed
=====================

A barebones seed project for getting started with PhoneGap and AngularJS (with routing!)

## Install

You just need to get these files into YourPhoneGapProject/www/, so either `git clone <url> www` or download the zip and move 'em in there. Note that I started from an iOS project on OS X 10.8.2, so act accordingly.

Directory structure:

```
/angular-phonegap-seed
    /css
        - index.css
    /img
        - logo.png
    /js
        - app.js
        - controllers.js
        - routers.js
    /lib
        - angular-1.0.5.js
        - cordova-2.5.0.js
    /partials
        - main.html
        - view.html
    /res
        - whatever is in res
```

Build and run your project, and you should be good to go.

Be aware that I have made no attempt to make it look attractive. This may eventually be improved upon.

## License

This repo is hereby free of bureaucratic bullshit, so fork to your heart's content. PhoneGap/Cordova, AngularJS, and all that code totally belongs to their respective humans/anthropomorphized legal entities. The licenses are in there. Don't sue me.
